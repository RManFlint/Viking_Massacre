I replaced Star Wars characters with Vikings because I have a cool pic for a background

I created html with buttons and images for each character.  The html was loaded in four separate <div>'s using the .html jQuery method.

I tried to use the button to designate the character selected by taking it id attribute value to get the html in the relevant <div>.  AFter doing so, it was my intention to use the .html method once again to take the html, i.e. the button and image, and place it in the empty <div> below the "Your Viking" <h3> text.  Although I did manage to get the pertinent id, I could not manage to get the html.  As a result, I could not change the inner html of the chosenViking <div> to change from &nbsp; to the desired button and image.
